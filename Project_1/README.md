# EFFECTIVE POTENTIAL AND TRANSFER ORBITS

## STATEMENT OF WORK

Imagine a typical technology that aims to take the Earth to a higher energy circular orbit of radius **r_a** = 2.25 A.U.

1 A.U. is the average distance between the Sun and the Earth, and is equal to 150 million km.
In order to do with the lowest amount of energy, Hohmann transfer orbit will be used. 
Hohmann orbits are semi-ellipses which may take an object from one circular orbit with a certain radius (and energy), to another circular
orbit of different radius (and energy).

In this exercise, we will assume that the Earth's orbit is practically circular.
